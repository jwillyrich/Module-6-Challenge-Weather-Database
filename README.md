# Module-6-Challenge-Weather-Database

**Overview of Project**

The purpose of this repository was to create inteactive maps using Google Maps, Places, and Directions APIs to provide a travel itinerary based on a user provided parameter of the temperature range they desired to spend their vacation in.

We used Geoviews to create a map that shows the four cities in the itinerary and used Geoapify Routing API to find a route between the citied in the itinerary.
